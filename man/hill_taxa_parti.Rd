\title{Decompostion of Taxonomic diversity through Hill Numbers}
\usage{
hill_taxa_parti(comm, q = 0, base = exp(1), rel_then_pool = TRUE,
  show.warning = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A data frame of vegtation data. Sites as rows, species as columns.}

\item{q}{Hill number, \code{q} = 0 (default) to get species richness,
\code{q} = 1 to get shannon entropy, \code{q} = 2 will give inverse Simpson.}

\item{base}{default is \code{exp(1)}, the base of log.}

\item{rel_then_pool}{default is \code{TRUE.} Abundance of species are first changed to relative abundance within sites,
then pooled into one assemblage. If \code{FALSE}, sites are pooled first, then change abundance of species
to relative abundance.}

\item{show.warning}{whether to print warning, default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row (across all sites), including these columns: q, gamma diversity, alpha diveristy,
beta diversity, MacArthur's homogeneity measure, local similarity (species overlap),
and region similarity (species overlap).
See Chao, Chiu and Jost 2014 Table 2 for more information.
}
\description{
Calculate taxonomic gamma, alpha, and beta diversity across all communities, as
well as site similarity. If comm has 2 sites, this function gives pair comparison.
If comm has >2 sites, gamma diversity is the diversity of the pooled assemblage,
alpha is the average diversity across all site, beta is across all communities.
